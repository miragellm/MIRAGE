p_mode_switch = """In this task, your goal is to navigate a map and reach a specified destination by taking appropriate actions. You will receive a step-by-step guide to help you complete this task. However, the guide may sometimes be incorrect or not perfectly match your current situation. 
Your job is to carefully check if the guide aligns with your current observation and decide whether to follow or explore.

At each decision point, clearly indicate whether you should 
1. follow the guide exactly (Follow mode)
2. deviate from it and explore your surroundings (Explore mode).

Respond using the following format:
Mode: <clearly describe your current step, summarize your situation, and provide reasoning for your decision>. Therefore, my current mode should be: <Follow/Explore>.

Here is an example:
Step-by-Step Guide to complete the task: 
Start! You are currently facing east.
Step 1. Turn right until you are facing south.
Step 2. Walk forward (toward south) 2 tiles, after that you will see There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the back-left tile and The front, front-right, left, back tiles are roads that you can step on.
Step 3. Turn left until you are facing east.
Step 4. Walk forward (toward east) 1 tile to get close to the destination.

Trajectory:
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you:
There is a cluster of green firs that spans the back, back-right tiles.
There is a cluster of red firs that spans the front, front-right tiles.
There is a house on the back-right tile.
The right tile is road that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the front-right tile.
The front-left, left, back-left tiles are out of the map boundary.
Direction: You are facing east.

Mode: I'm currently at Step 1, which instructs me to turn right until facing south. My current direction is east, and turning right from east once would correctly orient me south, matching the instruction. Therefore, my current mode should be: Follow.

Action: think[I want to follow the step 1 of the guide. the first instruction is to turn right until I'm facing south. Since I am facing east, turning right once will align me with the correct direction. Therefore, my next action should be to turn right to face south.]
Observation: OK.

Action: turn right
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you: 
There is a cluster of green firs that spans the front-right, right tiles.
There is a cluster of red firs that spans the front-left, left tiles.
There is a house on the front-right tile.
The front tiles are roads that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the front-left tile.
The back-left, back, back-right tiles are out of the map boundary.
Direction: You are facing south.

Mode: I'm now facing south, meaning that I have completed Step 1. At Step 2, I need to walk forward (south) two tiles. My front tile is road, meaning that I'm able to follow Step 2 to forward. Therefore, my current mode should be: Follow.

Action: think[I want to follow the step 2 of the guide. According to the guide, the next step is to forward 2 tiles. Observing my surroundings, I can see that the front tile is road, so I can safely proceed. Therefore, my next action is forward.]
Observation: OK.

Action: forward
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you: 
There is a cluster of green firs that spans the right, back-right tiles.
There is a cluster of red firs that spans the left, back-left tiles.
There is a house that spans the front-right, right tiles.
The front, back tiles are roads that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk that spans the front-left, left tiles.
Direction: You are facing south.

Mode: I'm still at Step 2, where I need to move forward (south) two tiles. I've moved forward one tile and need to move forward for another 2-1=1 tile. I can see that my front tile is still road so this action is possible. Therefore, my current mode should be: Follow.

Action: think[I have successfully moved forward, according to the instructions I need to move forward 2 times. Now I still need to move forward for 2-1=1 step. Observing my surroundings, I can see that the front tile is road, so I can safely proceed. Therefore, my next action is forward.]
Observation: OK.

Action: forward
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you: 
There is a cluster of green firs on the back-right tile.
There is a cluster of red firs on the back-left tile.
There is a house that spans the front-right, right, back-right tiles, the front-left, front, back tiles are roads that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk that spans the left, back-left tiles, and
Direction: You are facing south.

Mode: I've moved forward 2 tiles following step 2. However, in step 2 it says after moving forward 2 tiles I will see 'a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the back-left tile and the front, front-right, left, back tiles are roads'. However, this does not match my current observation. For example, the current front-right is a house, not road. I think maybe the number of tiles written in step 2 is wrong. I need to explore around to find the desired observation before moving to step 3. Therefore, my current mode should be: Explore.

Action: think[After exploring around with multiple agents, the best sequence of future actions that I think will guide me back to the correct path is forward.]
Observation: OK.

Action: forward
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you: 
The destination is on the front-left tile.
There is a house that spans the right, back-right tiles.
The front, front-right, left, back tiles are roads that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the back-left tile.
Direction: You are facing south.

Mode: After moving forward one step, my current observation now fully matches the conditions described at the end of Step 2: the orange tree is on my back-left tile, and the tiles at front, front-right, left, and back are all roads. This confirms that I've successfully completed Step 2 and am now ready to proceed to Step 3. Therefore, my current mode should be: Follow.

Action: turn left
Observation: You can see the 3x3 tiles surrounding you: 
The destination is on the front-right tile.
There is a house that spans the back-left, back tiles.
The front, left, right, back-right tiles are roads that you can step on.
There is a orange tree with a hollow trunk on the front-left tile.
Direction: You are facing east.

Mode: I've completed Step 3 and am now facing east. According to Step 4, I should walk forward (toward east) 1 tile to get close to the destination. My front tile is road so I can forward. Therefore, my current mode should be: Follow.

Reasoning: Based on my current trajectory, originally I failed to move forward after turning right following step 4 of the step-by-step guide.

Example 2:
Reasoning: The step-by-step guide step 2 instructs me to move forward for 3 tiles. I have move forward 1 tiles in the original trajectory. The best strategy seems to be Plan 1, which follows the guide to directly goes forward more times. Therefore I will follow plan 1.

Reasoning: The step-by-step guide step 1 instructs me to move forward for 3 tiles and turn towards north when I see a tower on the right tile. However, after moving forward 3 times, I didn't see the tower on the right tile, but it's on the front-right tile instead.

1. You can move one tile per action.
2. If the guide instructs you to move multiple tiles (e.g., âwalk forward 5 tilesâ), you should execute that as five individual forward actions.
