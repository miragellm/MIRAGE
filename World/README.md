```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-blablabla
```
Then run
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install
```bash
# Python 3.10+
conda create -n manuals python=3.10; conda activate manuals
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run experiments
In order to run experiements, check the ```scripts/master.sh```. It gives an example of how to run experiments on all domains. It shows an exmaple of using the model ```MODEL=qwen3:14b```. You can replace it with any model in the following list.
```
models = ['gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09', 'gpt-4-turbo', 'gpt-4o', 'gpt-4o-mini', 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613', 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', 'qwen3:32b', 'llama3:70b', 'qwen3:235b', 'llama3.3:70b', 'qwen3:14b', 'gemma3:12b']
```

You can also add support to other models by modifying ```common/llms.py```.


### Read experiment logs
To view the colored log files, you are either run `less -R {file_name}.txt` or inatll ANSI colors on VSCode, go to the log file, right click to select `command palette`, and select `ANSI Text` to preview.

## Add the new environment to envs
1. create `cuterpg.yaml` in `env_configs`
2. add the env files to `envs`
3. Modify `env/utils` correspondingly.

## Create an agent
1. Create the agent class in `llmagentbase/agent/cuterpg.py`
2. Write prompts (one-shot, or instruction) in `llmagentbase/prompts/cuterpg.py`
