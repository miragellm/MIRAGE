cook_instruction = """In this task, you are a chef in a restaurant. You will be asked to cook some dishes for the customers. Some needed ingredients are already stored at the restaurant, but some are not. Therfore, you need to gather all needed ingredients at farm, store, and harbor, and then go back to the restaurant to cook the dish(es) in kitchen, with the goal of generating actions to complete all required dishes.
At each time step, you will be provided with the following inputs:
1. The result of your latest action.

You can only issue the following actions in this environment, one at a time:
    goto <location> -> You can go to restaurant, farm, store, and harbor_<id>, where harbor id includes 1, 2, 3.
    harvest <crop>
    fish <seafood>
    buy <ingredient>
    put <ingredient> into <tool> -> <tool> includes cooking tools, cutting_board, and plate_<id>.
    chop <ingredient>
    wait -> Use this when you have nothing more to do but some <tool> hasn't finish cooking.
    plate from <tool> into plate_<id> -> You can only plate into a plate, not including other cooking tools.
    serve plate_<id> -> Use this after you finish a dish in a plate.
    think[...] -> Use this to reason about your next move. Add any internal thoughts or planning here.

Here is some other instructions:
1. You can only perform one action at a time. You must exacly follow the pattern specied below.
2. When you mention an ingredient, be clear. For example, say "raw,chopped lettuce" instead of "raw lettuce" or "chopped lettuce" or "lettuce".
3. You have 10 plates in the kitchen (plate_0~plate_9).
4. A dish must have one of the two possible kinds of sensonings, during_cooking and after_cooking. For during_cooking seasonings, you can only add them when the ingredients are still in the cooking tools (not plated yet). For after_cooking ones, you can only add them to the plates, i.e. the ingredients are already plated.
5. If you successfully complete a dish, you will be told that the plate contains the dish. Otherwise, all the ingredients in the plate will be listed. Therefore, you can only assume that you complete a dish if you are told the plate contains <dish name>.
6. All dishes must be cooked at the restaurant.
"""

# 5. You don't need to serve a dish. You will directly get the reward after all ingredients are plated.

You can only issue the following actions in this environment, one at a time:

Here is some other instructions:
1. You can only perform one action at a time. You must exacly follow the pattern specied below.
2. When you mention an ingredient, be clear. For example, say "raw,chopped lettuce" instead of "raw lettuce" or "chopped lettuce" or "lettuce".
3. You have 10 plates in the kitchen (plate_0~plate_9).
4. A dish must have one of the two possible kinds of sensonings, during_cooking and after_cooking. For during_cooking seasonings, you can only add them when the ingredients are still in the cooking tools (not plated yet). For after_cooking ones, you can only add them to the plates, i.e. the ingredients are already plated.
5. If you successfully complete a dish, you will be told that the plate contains the dish. Otherwise, all the ingredients in the plate will be listed. Therefore, you can only assume that you complete a dish if you are told the plate contains <dish name>.
6. All dishes must be cooked at the restaurant.
