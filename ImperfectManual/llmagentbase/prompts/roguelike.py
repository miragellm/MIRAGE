In this task, you will play through a turn-based roguelike RPG with the goal of defeating the final-floor boss **while following the supplied strategy guide**.

At every time step you receive a textual *Observation* that contains:
1. The current **level type** (growth, combat, shop, or boss) and a short environmental description.
2. Lists of **Collectible Items**, **Containers**, **NPCs/Enemies**, **Readable Objects**, plus any shop stock or rumours.
3. Your character sheet: HP, coins, inventory weight / capacity, full inventory with elemental tags, and Max Steps remaining.

You may issue actions only from the following action list (one per time step):

    think[...]                -> Private reasoning or planning (the environment echoes back “OK.”). Do not overuse it. Specifically, you cannot think with similar output multiple times, which causes useless duplication.
    collect <item>            -> Pick up a listed collectible item.
    open <container>          -> Open a container and automatically scoop up its contents.
    craft <item>              -> Combine the exact required materials in your inventory.
    discard <item>            -> Drop an item to free weight.
    unequip                   -> for all environments
    equip <weapon>            -> Wield a weapon from your inventory.
    attack <enemy>            -> Strike the target (must have a weapon equipped).
    buy <item>                -> Purchase from a shop if you meet the cost.
    talk <npc>                -> Speak with an NPC.
    read <object>             -> Read flavour or clue text.
    leave                     -> Exit the current level and advance to the next.
    recipes                   -> Show a list of available crafting recipes.

Movement between rooms is abstracted: *leave* is the only navigation verb.



Game constraints and tips
-------------------------
* **Inventory weight** cannot exceed the stated capacity; discard or skip surplus loot.
* **Crafting** instantly consumes materials; partial recipes are invalid.
* Elemental effectiveness matters in combat: e.g. FIRE > ICE, WATER > FIRE.
* Feel free to interleave `think[...]` steps to plan, but don't overuse it. they do **not** cost extra time beyond one action.

Good luck, adventurer!

In this task, you will play through a turn-based roguelike RPG with the goal of defeating the final-floor boss **while following the supplied strategy guide**.

At every time step you receive a textual *Observation* that contains:
1. The current **level type** (growth, combat, shop, or boss) and a short environmental description.
2. Lists of **Collectible Items**, **Containers**, **NPCs/Enemies**, **Readable Objects**, plus any shop stock or rumours.
3. Your character sheet: HP, coins, inventory weight / capacity, full inventory with elemental tags, and Max Steps remaining.

You will be given a 'current subgoal' to accomplish, as one part of the trajectory to achieve the final goal. You should try your best to accomplish the current subgoal, and when it's done, issue a stop action.

You may issue actions only from the following action list (one per time step):

    think[...]                -> Private reasoning or planning (the environment echoes back “OK.”). Do not overuse it. Specifically, you cannot think with similar output multiple times, which causes useless duplication.
    collect <item>            -> Pick up a listed collectible item.
    open <container>          -> Open a container and automatically scoop up its contents.
    craft <item>              -> Combine the exact required materials in your inventory.
    discard <item>            -> Drop an item to free weight.
    unequip                   -> for all environments
    equip <weapon>            -> Wield a weapon from your inventory.
    attack <enemy>            -> Strike the target (must have a weapon equipped).
    buy <item>                -> Purchase from a shop if you meet the cost.
    talk <npc>                -> Speak with an NPC.
    read <object>             -> Read flavour or clue text.
    leave                     -> Exit the current level and advance to the next.
    recipes                   -> Show a list of available crafting recipes.
    stop                   -> Issue this action when you think the current subgoal is accomplished

Movement between rooms is abstracted: *leave* is the only navigation verb.
Important: note that you can not go back to the previous level once you leave. Therefore, do not leave the level unless the subgoal specifically ask you to do that. 
Important: You should NEVER generate consecutive think[...] actions!

Game constraints and tips
-------------------------
* **Inventory weight** cannot exceed the stated capacity; discard or skip surplus loot.
* **Crafting** instantly consumes materials; partial recipes are invalid.
* Elemental effectiveness matters in combat: e.g. FIRE > ICE, WATER > FIRE.

Good luck, adventurer!

Here is one example from ANOTHER task. it shows the command and strategy you interact with the enviroment. Note that the item you need in your task can be DIFFERENT:
The guide for THAT example:
trategy Guide for Roguelike Game:
You will face a ICE-element boss on the final floor.
To counter it effectively, we recommend using a FIRE-element weapon: Inferno Blaster.

To craft Inferno Blaster, follow these steps:
- Craft Fire Staff using 1 Fire Essence, 1 Weapon Prototype
- Craft Fire Enhancer using 2 Fire Essence, 1 Magic Catalyst
- Craft Inferno Blaster using 1 Fire Staff, 1 Fire Enhancer, 1 Enchanted Cloth

You will need to collect items from the following levels:
Level 1 (growth):
 - Fire Essence ×1 (one on the ground)
Level 2 (growth):
 - Fire Essence ×1 (one in the tide pool, one in the wooden crate. you only need to collect 1 of them.)
 - Water Crystal ×1 (one on the ground, we collect this for trading it in the shop later)
Level 3 (combat):
 - Enchanted Cloth ×1 (one from defeating Restless Blizzard Spirit)
Level 4 (growth):
 - Magic Catalyst ×1 (one on the ground, one in the stalagmite. you only need to collect 1 of them.)
Level 5 (shop):
 - Fire Essence ×1 (one in the shop, use Water Crystal to trade it; you can also buy one using a coin.)
Everytime you want to fight an enemy, arm yourself with the most powerful weapon against it.
